description: '
  This pattern is meant to be used for OMIA Mendelian diseases (https://omia.org/) which are defined by a variation in a gene. Note that this pattern does not include an "in taxon" annotation as the species can be inferred by the gene record. This pattern is analogous to the human disease "OMIM_disease_series_by_gene" pattern. '
